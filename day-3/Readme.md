What are functions ?
- A way to encapsulate program functionality
- Optionally accept data
- Utilization for code organization
    - Also makes codes easier to read
- Can be executed by calling the function
- Optionally "returns" data
    - Data sent back from the function

eg. fn add(a:i32, b:i32) -> i32 {
    a+b
}

- Macros expand into additional code
- Println "Prints" information to the terminal
